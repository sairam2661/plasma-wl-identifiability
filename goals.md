# Goals

- We want to determine if samples from the same patient (taken at different timepoints) can be reliably distinguished from samples of different patients.
  - Essentially, we hypothesize that each person has a unique profile of peptidoforms that persist over time despite weight loss (and changes across other factors)

## Implications

- Able to trace back annonymous samples to individual patients (threat to privacy?)
- Able to identify patients with similar peptidoform profiles (useful for personalized medicine?)
